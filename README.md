I have been using lunarvim for a long time, and decided to just shift to my own neovim config. 

I took a lot of the plugins that I liked in lunarvim, and have applied them here, and added a few others. 

This shift was by no means because I found fault with lunarvim, I just wanted to take the time to really understand the new lua config for nvim and have decided I like where it has ended up.
